## Sudoku Solver in Java

**Project Overview**
This project implements a Sudoku solver using Java. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find solutions to a given Sudoku puzzle, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

**Features**
- Backtracking Algorithm: Efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles by exploring all possible solutions.
- Input Validation: Ensures the initial Sudoku grid is valid before attempting to solve it.
- User Interface: Simple console-based UI for inputting Sudoku puzzles and displaying solutions.
